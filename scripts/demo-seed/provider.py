"""Scripted OpenAI-compatible provider (issue #72 demo seeding).

Deterministic playback of pre-authored triage responses — ZERO runtime
inference, no API tokens, no GPU. Serves the exact contract the product's
inference layer speaks for engine=openai_compatible (verified against
langchain_openai's function_calling path):

- POST /v1/chat/completions with tools + forced tool_choice
  (SupervisorDecision | ConstrainedSupervisorDecision | VerdictDraft)
- response: assistant message with tool_calls[0].function.{name,arguments}
  echoing the forced tool name, finish_reason="tool_calls". Usage is
  reported as ZERO: playback is not inference, and fake usage gets priced
  by the real cost governor (it tripped the demo box's $15/day tenant cap
  and froze run claims mid-drain).

Routing: the seeder writes a manifest (JSON: script-key → play) before
injecting; script keys are unique host tokens that appear verbatim in the
supervisor/verdict prompts. Router calls advance a per-key route counter
(INVESTIGATE → VERDICT); verdict calls return the authored VerdictDraft.

Unmatched verdict prompts get GENERIC_VERDICT, a benign close whose
rationale is explicitly marked as playback (so it can never be mistaken
for real analysis). This is correct on the seeded tenant, where the
in-cluster worker is scaled to zero and every reasoning call is either
ours or a reopened benign item. IMPORTANT: this worker is tenant-bound,
not seed-bound — before starting it against a live tenant, ensure there
are no pre-existing/organic claimable runs, or it will close them with
this generic rationale (Codex P1). The bootstrap runbook enforces this.
