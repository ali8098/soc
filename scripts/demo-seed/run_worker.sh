# Cost-safe launcher for the demo-seed runs-worker (issue #72).
#
# Starts the worker in a SCRUBBED environment (env -i) so no leaked
# per-tier provider var (SOCTALK_FAST_*, SOCTALK_REASONING_*, ANTHROPIC_*,
# a stray OPENAI_BASE_URL) can route a call to a paid provider — the Codex
# P0 hole. Runs preflight.py first and refuses to start the worker unless
# every resolved tier points at the local stub.
#
# Usage:
#   STUB=http://127.0.0.1:8091/v1 API=http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
#   WORKER_TOKEN=/tmp/seed-worker-token PROJECT=/path/to/soctalk \
#   scripts/demo-seed/run_worker.sh
set -euo pipefail

# A minimal, explicit environment. env -i drops EVERYTHING (including any
# .env-independent shell exports); we then add back only what the worker
# needs and the single stub key. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set EMPTY so the
# app's own load_dotenv() cannot re-populate it (dotenv won't override a
# set var).
