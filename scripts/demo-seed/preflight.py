"""Cost-safety preflight for the demo seeder worker (issue #72).

The zero-API-token guarantee is only real if the worker CANNOT reach any
paid provider. Clearing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not enough: per-tier env
(SOCTALK_<TIER>_PROVIDER/_BASE_URL/_API_KEY/_ENGINE) can independently
point a tier at Anthropic or the Modal Qwen endpoint, and the presence of
tier config even relaxes the provider mutual-exclusion check (Codex P0).

This asserts, against the FULLY LOADED soctalk config (which itself calls
load_dotenv, so it sees any leak), that every resolved tier's base URL is
the local stub. Exit non-zero — and loud — otherwise. Run it immediately
before the worker, in the same environment.
